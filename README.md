Written while addled & confused during a 5 hour flight delay after getting up at a Too Early Hour. Normally I try to make code good, but this time, as a treat, I didn't

Inspired by and color scheme from: https://github.com/tenpages/us-level, which in term seems to have been inspired by https://lab.magiconch.com/china-ex/ and
https://zhung.com.tw/japanex/

World Map taken from https://simplemaps.com/resources/svg-world, while those inspirations have nicely stylized maps that make it easier to click things, so I might update that

Also uses [svg-pan-zoom](https://github.com/bumbu/svg-pan-zoom) for panning and zooming the svg
